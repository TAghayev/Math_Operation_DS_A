# Math_Operations

You are provided with a series of Java classes. These classes are used to create a program that allows users to enter math operations that can then be processed to get the results. This project has been modified to use a Stack data structure. 

Instead of using an already existing Stack, we have created our own. 
This project showcases my knowledge of Data Structures & Algorithms and their implementation.

The program has the following operations:
1) Add Addition
2) Add Subtraction
3) Add Multiplication
4) Add Divsion
5) Run operations
6) Reverse Order
7) Print Top
8) Remove Top
9) Author Info
0) Exit
